=Introduction=

"maketext-js" (aka Locale.Maketext) is a framework for localization.
This is actually JavaScript porting of Sean M. Burke's [http://search.cpan.org/~ferreira/Locale-Maketext-1.13/lib/Locale/Maketext.pod Maketext] (Perl module).


=Synopsis=

For instance, you can write Web page supporting both English and Japanese in the following codes:

MyI18N.js
{{{
var MyI18N = new Locale.Maketext({
    languages: [
        'en',
        'ja'
    ]
});
}}}

en.js
{{{
MyI18N.lexicon("en", {
    "Input your name.": "Input your name.",
    "Hello, [_1]!"    : "Hello, [_1]!"
});
}}}

ja.js
{{{
MyI18N.lexicon("ja", {
    "Input your name.": "名前を入力してください．",
    "Hello, [_1]!"    : "[_1]さん，こんにちは！"
});
}}}

your.html
{{{
<script type="text/javascript" src="Locale-Maketext.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="MyI18N.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
  MyI18N.getHandle({
    onSuccess: function( handle ) {
      var name = prompt(handle.maketext("Input your name."));
      alert(handle.maketext("Hello, [_1]!", "hoge"));
    }
  });
</script>
}}}

That's it!
